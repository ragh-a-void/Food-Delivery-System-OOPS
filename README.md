     - **Special Customers** - 20/- delivery charge per order (25/- off on bill value greater than 200/- after restaurant discount) 

    (Note: Apply restaurant discount first on bill value, then apply customer discount)

4) Restaurants need to pay 1% of the total bill value (after discounts) to the food tech company (Assume Restaurants have surplus money to pay)

5) Owners must add categories to each food item so that customers can have clarity.
    
    The categories consist of : 
      - Starter 
      - Main Course
      - Dessert
      - Beverage

6) Customers start with Rs. 1000/- in their account, which will be called the wallet. (For sake of simplicity, assume this is the maximum which a customer can spend, no more top-up)

7) There is a reward scheme for customers as follows -
    - **Fast food** - 10 points per 150/- spent
    - **Authentic restaurants** - 25 points per 200/- spent
    - **Rest** - 5 points per 100/- spent

    (All the above rewards are applicable on total order value after all discounts, 1 point = 1 rupee)

8) The reward points must be added:
    - **Customer** - To the rewards account of the customer.
    - **Restaurant** - The same points must also be added to the restaurant
    
    (Restaurants don‚Äôt use the reward points, it is just for rating purpose)

9) When a customer makes a purchase, the amount must be deducted from the rewards account first and then from the wallet.

10) A customer may add food items from only one restaurant in a single order.
